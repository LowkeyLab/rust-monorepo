///     Discord Role. The bot applies any nickname changes as specified by this command. \
///     This command assumes that the bot has a higher Role than all users which invoke this \
///     command. \
///     In certain failure scenarios, such as offering an invalid nickname, the bot will \
///     reply with information about the invalid command.
